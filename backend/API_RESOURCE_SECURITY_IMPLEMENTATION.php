/**
 * API Resource Security Implementation Summary
 * 
 * This document outlines the completed security updates to the API Resources
 * to protect PII for guest users and implement secure media handling.
 */

/*
=============================================================================
COMPLETED SECURITY UPDATES
=============================================================================

1. API Resource PII Protection:
   - DoctorResource: Protected license_number, email, phone for guests
   - ClinicResource: Protected phone, email for guests
   - BeforeAfterResource: Protected PII in nested doctor/clinic data
   - StoryResource: Protected PII in nested doctor/clinic/owner data

2. Secure Media Handling:
   - Implemented getMediaUrl() method in all resources
   - Public media: Uses Storage::url() for public paths
   - Private media: Uses temporarySignedRoute() with 10-minute expiry
   - MediaController: Handles signed URL validation and file streaming

3. Required Fields Added:
   - is_promoted: Boolean promotion status
   - verified: Boolean verification status (from verified_at field)
   - rating_avg: Average rating with fallback to legacy 'rating' field
   - rating_count: Rating count with fallback to legacy 'total_reviews' field

4. Shared Security Trait:
   - Created HandlesSecureMedia trait for code reuse
   - Provides standardized doctor/clinic data methods
   - Centralized guest detection and media URL generation

=============================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
=============================================================================

Guest Detection:
- Uses request->attributes->get('is_guest') set by OptionalAuthenticate middleware
- Fallback to !auth()->check() for compatibility

Media Security Logic:
- Public paths (avatars/, covers/, public/): Direct Storage::url()
- Private paths: Temporary signed URLs with 10-minute expiry
- Before/after photos: Always private (medical content)
- Stories: Always private (user content)

PII Protection Fields:
- Doctor: license_number, email, phone
- Clinic: phone, email
- Nested objects: Same PII protection applied

Required Fields Implementation:
- is_promoted: Direct field access with false fallback
- verified: Derived from !is_null(verified_at)
- rating_avg: New field with fallback to legacy 'rating'
- rating_count: New field with fallback to legacy 'total_reviews'

=============================================================================
API ROUTES STRUCTURE
=============================================================================

Media Routes:
- GET /api/v1/media/{id}?signature=...&expires=... (Private media)
- GET /api/v1/media/public/{type}/{filename} (Public media)

Public API Routes (opt.auth middleware):
- GET /api/home (Guest-friendly with PII protection)
- GET /api/stories (Guest-friendly with PII protection)
- GET /api/clinics/top (Guest-friendly with PII protection)
- GET /api/doctors/top (Guest-friendly with PII protection)
- GET /api/before-after (Guest-friendly with PII protection)
- GET /api/search (Guest-friendly with PII protection)

Protected API Routes (auth:api middleware):
- All routes requiring authentication return full data including PII

=============================================================================
SECURITY BENEFITS
=============================================================================

1. PII Protection:
   - Guest users cannot see sensitive personal information
   - Authenticated users get full data access
   - Consistent protection across all resource types

2. Media Security:
   - Private medical content protected with signed URLs
   - Public content served efficiently without signatures
   - Automatic expiry prevents URL sharing abuse

3. Performance:
   - Public media cached for 24 hours
   - Private media cached for 1 hour
   - Intelligent fallback for legacy field names

4. Compliance:
   - GDPR-friendly by protecting PII for unauthenticated requests
   - Medical data protection for before/after photos
   - Audit trail through signed URL validation

=============================================================================
TESTING CHECKLIST
=============================================================================

□ Guest API calls exclude PII fields
□ Authenticated API calls include all fields
□ Public media URLs work without signatures
□ Private media URLs require valid signatures
□ Signed URLs expire after 10 minutes
□ Before/after photos always use signed URLs
□ Story media always uses signed URLs
□ Avatar/cover photos use appropriate security level
□ Rating fields use new columns with legacy fallback
□ Promotion fields work correctly
□ Verification status derives from verified_at
